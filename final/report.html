    <h1>Final Project Expert Review & Report</h1>
    <h2>Summary of Key Findings</h2>
    <p>There were two sets of pairs that faced off for two tests--one without verbal explanation and once again with clarification. While playing they were instructed to verbalize any and all thoughts they had during the playthrough. Both groups pointed out the same key features/issues. Above all else, the instructions page needs to be improved upon--mentioning the irrelevance of the stem colors and the stylization of the page to be more legible could be improved upon. Also including the player switch is pertinent so that this aspect of the gameplay doesn't catch the players off guard. Also to emphasize more on the player switch on the gameplay screen itself and differentiate it from the game ending. 
    <br>
    There were a total of 4 participants, 2 casual players and 2 competetive gamers. The casual players where observed in person on the same device while the other two played online while screen sharing their screen. Responses and screen were recorded with consent of the players to refer back to at a later time.
