    <h1>Final Project Review & Report</h1>
    <h2>Summary of Key Findings</h2>
    <p>There were two sets of pairs that faced off for two tests--one without verbal explanation (the users were just observed) and once again with clarification. Before playing they were instructed to verbalize any and all thoughts they had during the playthrough. Both groups pointed out the same key features/issues. Above all else, the instructions page needs to be improved upon--mentioning the irrelevance of the stem colors and the stylization of the page to be more legible could be improved upon. Also including the player switch is pertinent so that this aspect of the gameplay doesn't catch the players off guard. Also to emphasize more on the player switch on the gameplay screen itself and differentiate it from the game ending. 
    <br>
    There were a total of 4 participants, 2 casual players and 2 competetive gamers. The casual players where observed in person on the same device while the other two played online while screen sharing their screen. Responses and screen were recorded with consent of the players to refer back to at a later time. 
    </p>

    <h2>Results of Tests</h2>
    <h3>Set 1: Casual</h3>
    <p>Name: Nikita, Age: 21, Games: Never</p>
    <ol>
        <li>stressful; new and fast
            <ul>
                <li>initially confused and didn't know when to stop her turn</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>clicking was weird (bug?); instructions were written in a way to be absorbed easily
            <ul>
                <li>for the flower thing, make it more obvious that the flower is gacha? (figure out word)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>cute visuals; easy, didn't feel lost in navigation
            <ul>
                <li>showing both scores at the end screen</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>countdown switch instead of having the 'SWITCH' text to the side; switch in the center of the blacked-out screen</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Name: Katie; Age: 21; Games: Rarely (bimonth)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>fun, like the aesthetic</li>
        <li>the switching players was rough; maybe include time in instructions/just mention the player switch</li>
        <li>cute aesthetics; good color good fonts fitting for the stylization</li>
        <li>colors of the stems was confusing at first
            <ul>
                <li>Maybe include pikmin at the end screen to tie the visuals together</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Set 2: Competitive</h3>
    <p>Name: Dani; Age: 31; Games: Often (daily)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>cute and fun, explained adequately enough, not over-explained; visually, should adjust better in proportion better</li>
        <li>being able to opt into the game; prep time after the instruction screen (for both players)</li>
        <li>cute visuals; maybe mention stem difference “stem color has no effect on point”</li>
        <li>music goes hard; maybe show both scores for the winning screen (show more info)
            <ul>
                <li>Potentionally allow volume adjustment or mute option</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Name: Marie; Age: 22; Games: Often (daily)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Gamble and clickly; simply but fun</li>
        <li>button => count down => play
            <ul>
                <li>Include something about switching in the instructions; just make sure the user knows (and is prepared for that switch)</li>
                <li>Maybe move the disclaimer to the title screen to make space for instructions</li>
                <li>Clarify the flower rule</li>
                <li>Fun but unneccesary: highlight the achievement of beating the other player</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Potentially offer difference backgrounds for the game screen</li>
        <li>Include something more for the hover on the title screen, maybe include a second animation for variance</li>
    </ol>
