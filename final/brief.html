    <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    <p>I chose to expand on the Game On! project because I feel like I have a clear direction for this project that is pretty clever. Other than actually creating the site, a way I was thinking about improving it was in usability. Given the time limit and my lack of time for the deadline project deadline, I plan to follow along my design plan and later expand on it to fix any of the kinks, bring it to a state of playability. I also want to ensure the navigation and functionality are intuitive, allowing users to interact with the site effortlessly. I intend ot share my ideas and get feedback from a range of gamers, both casual and more competative-though I would then need to figure out a roundabout way to make it multiplayer online (potentially a way to input the other's score and then play the game themselves).</p>
