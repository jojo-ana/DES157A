    <h1>Final Project Process Visualizations</h1>
    <h2>Usablity Test</h2>
    <p>The main thing I want to focus on is the UX/UI for my project. There will be two sets of people playing the game, a versus match between two casuals (games less than once per month) and a versus match between two competitives--a total of four testers. With these two groups, there will be two types of tests. The first test is a blind playthrough and just letting the players figure out the game and mechanics themselves. After this, I will explain anything they were confused about in the first playthrough and make them play again, observing any differences.</p>
    <p> The interview questions are very open-ended:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thoughts about the game experience</li>
        <li>Things that could be better mechanically or in explanation</li>
        <li>How are the visuals</li>
        <li>Any other thoughts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>still need to put</p>

    <h2>Functionality</h2>
    <p>The side thing I want to work on but put less focus on is adding a single-player option.</p>

    <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
